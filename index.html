        <h2>About the Guitar</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The guitar is so fun and amazing! You can improvise your own licks, riffs and solos. I am 10 years old and in 5th grade. Whenever I get bored, I just pick up the guitar and travel into the universe of music. The guitar makes our fingers and hands strong. The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.

Guitar, plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The basics of all the guitars are the acoustic steel-string guitar. Once you are pro at it then you can switch to Nylon string or an Electric Guitar. Steel-string acoustic guitars are commonly used by beginners. Considering the playability and quality, steel strings are pocket-friendly. This was just rough estimate as to the average price of an acoustic guitar but should give you some idea. Most guitarists, in my experience, will buy somewhere in the $500 to $1,500 range. Beginners usually spend between $100 and $500. More serious guitarists who have a high budget can spend anywhere from $1,500 to $10,000. By the way, my electric guitar is 24,000 Rs.</p>
